# CRUD Blog with MVC Framework

This project will be the last one before learning Laravel Framework. I guessed it would be better to learn thoroughly about what is MVC framework and how it works. Moreover, I believed it would help me easier to learn Laravel Framework.
There's nothing fancy in this project. Just the login/register system and CRUD blog application where you can create, update and delete your own and read others' blog post.
